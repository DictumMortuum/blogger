The duskblade is a basic class from the 3.5e Player's Handbook II. The main characteristic of the class is that it is a hybrid fighter and wizard out-of-the-can.

For as long as I can remember, the perfect gish build was something that the optimization community worked on. A gish originally referred to a Githyanki fighter/wizard combination. Soon, it started to be used for all multiclass characters that used magic and weapons. In 3.5e a variety of builds started to form a standard, employing prestige classes that progressed both base attack bonus and caster level.

## When to play duskblade

Using builds that rely on extensive multiclassing is not appealing. You may not have access to all the books that you need. You might not be able to fit the prerequisites required for the prestige classes and the abilities you want. If you are like me, you might even consider extensive multiclassing ugly, in an aesthetic sense. Bottom line, if you want to play a gish, but you don't want to plan a complex character build, then Duskblade is a perfect fit.

The abilities that the Duskblade class offers, with the exception of arcane channeling feel generic. This is because most of them don't offer alternatives, like bonus feats. Seasoned players may not like limited options, but at the same time it is helpful for new players. Inexperienced players that wish to play a gish can pick up Duskblade and they can't mess up if they avoid multiclassing.

Another feature of the class is spontaneous spellcasting. This kind of spellcasting is prefered due to its simplicity. Even more experienced players choose classes with spontaneous spellcasting if they want to minimize their character's upkeep.

You just need two books to play the class - player's handbook I and player's handbook II. These two books contain optimal choices for your race, feats and equipment. Almost the entirety of your skills and spells are contained in them, while other classes require material from different books. This is the biggest perk of the class: it is not spread out.

Recently, a classification for classes called tiers has surfaced and gained popularity. This is a quick and dirty method to determine a class's power level, using five tiers. This should be used only as a guideline, as in 3.5e taking levels in a tier 1 class does not guarantee a tier 1 build quality. Duskblades fall somewhere in the lower middle of this ranking, in tier 3. Do not be discouraged by this,  tier 3 is considered to be the best power level for normal play. Use this piece of information to compare your power level to that of your teammates. If the difference is higher than two tiers, then this might influence your game negatively. For instance, in a party with druids and wizard, a duskable may feel inadequate. Unfortunately, you can do this analysis if you know the players beforehand, it is not applicable in new parties.

The duskblade is a class that favors dealing damage in high amounts. Aside from that, it is not good in anything else. Investigate the campaign that you are going to join and ask the dungeon master for information. If you are going to face a fair number of encounters each day, then you are good to go. If the encounters are going to be sparse, then it might be a good idea to pick another class. A bard or a beguiler for instance has a wide array of noncombat abilities that are useful and fall in the same power level.

## The duskblade's role

The part of the game that a duskblade excels in is dealing hit point damage. [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better), also called New Jersey style, was conceived by Richard P. Gabriel to describe the dynamics of software acceptance, but it has broader application. The idea is that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality. There is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Adapting this design style to the dusklade class, we have the following characteristics, excluding **correctness**:

**Simplicity.** A duskblade deals hit point damage with his attacks and spells. The two can be combined with his class ability arcane channeling. The duskblade uses a simple and intuitive way of dealing damage. Compared to other classes the duskblade functions the same at all levels of play. The playstyle of other spellcasting classes, like the druid or the wizard, changes often. Playing a duskblade partly means that you commit to dealing damage this way.

**Consistency.** Duskblades receive a high number of spells per day. They can use their damage dealing abilities often. The amount of damage that comes from their spellcasting ability scales. There are certain levels that unlock more powerful spells. Increase your number of spells per day only if you keep your build simple.

**Competeness.** The spell list of the duskblade class contains different energy type spells. Picking up different spells as you level up will enable you to cover all reasonably expected cases. Sacrifice competeness when the simplicity of your build is jeopardized. Do not go to great lengths to increase your spells known.

# Attributes

## <span class="navy">Strength</span>

The Duskblade is mainly a melee class. Melee combat relies heavily on strength. Remember that the main form of hit point damage of a Duskblade is melee attacks with Arcane Channeling. This attribute is going to provide additional damage and attack bonus. If you are using a two-handed weapon, the damage bonus is going to get multiplied.

Strength is also helpful with alternative combat maneuvers, like grapple, bull rush and sunder. This is because these maneuvers often use strength checks. Increasing strength also helps defending against some of these, because the rolls are contested. Having better defenses against these maneuvers is not a priority, but a good addition for a melee class.

Duskblades are primarily melee, but, having ranged damage readily available is important. Do remember if you are using a composite longbow you can buy one suited to your strength. This way you can translate your strength score to ranged damage. This applies mainly at low to mid levels, where you can't use your spells all the time.

The human race is the most optimal choice for a duskblade build. However, an illumian with the Aeshkrau sigil and high strength does have good synergy. This power sigil combination allow the illumian to use his strength score to determine bonus spells. The bonus, unfortunately, doesn't extent to the save difficulty class, but saves are rarely an issue in a duskblade build.

The suggested starting value is 14. Try to increase your strength score whenever it is possible. You can do this through attribute bonuses that all characters get every four levels. Another way would be a typical magical item that gives enhancement bonus.

## Dexterity

Avoid dexterity as your main combat skill. The duskblade is a feat starved class; it receives no bonus feats. Using melee weapons with dexterity means that you will have to get weapon finesse. Spending a feat slot that could be used for better feats, like power attack, is not encouraged.

This doesn't mean that dexterity is a dump stat, though. As a melee frontline combatant, the duskblade benefits from abilities like combat reflexes. Abilities like that have a minimum dexterity requirement, partly because they scale according to it. For this reason, its suggested starting value is 10-14.

Finally, dexterity boosts armor class and the duskblade's weakest save: reflex.

## <span class="blue">Constitution</span>

Constitution is the attribute that determines your character's health and fortitude save. Duskblades have a d8 hit die, which is respectable. The fortitude saves are primary for the duskblade class. Regarding skills, constitution helps only concentration.

All these facts do not make constitution the top priority for duskblades. However, as a melee class, you  can never have enough hit points, as you need them to stay alive. The suggested starting value is 14.

# Class Features

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

> Duskblades are proficient with all martial weapons, as well as all armors and shields (except tower shields).

> Errata: Page 19 – Duskblade Class Features; Weapon and Armor Proficiency [Omission]

> The "Weapon and Armor Proficiency" Class feature for duskblades should state: "Duskblades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons."

Duskblades have the default proficiencies most martial classes get.

There are three main weapon styles that a character can choose from. These are:

* Two weapon style.
* Two-handed weapon style.
* Weapon and shield style.

The duskblade, being a hit point damage dealer, will most often choose two-handed weapon style. There is just two much synergy for a melee class that favors strength. Power attack damage is doubled and strength damage is multiplied by x1.5, just for wielding a weapon with both hands. The greatsword is the weapon that is used for sheer damage. A great alternative is the guisarme, which has reach and can be used to trip enemies. As the duskblade gains levels, weapon special abilities become more important than damage numbers. Reach or the ability to disarm, trip or prepare against a charge are more precious than just a couple points of damage.

Fighting with two weapons is not out of the question for a duskblade, but it is not a priority. One can combine this fighting style with two-handed weapon style if using double weapons. The main reason to pick it up is to optimize the arcane channeling ability, after attaining level 13. If you can increase your number of melee attacks in a round, then you can channel more spells. This weapon style requires that your dexterity score is better than at least 13.

Shields are effective tools to increase your armor class a couple of points during the early levels. Unfortunately, you can't combine shields and two-handed weapons. Some additional armor class doesn't warrant giving up double power attack or x1.5 strength damage. At later levels, an animated shield is a good addition to the duskblade's equipment.

## Spells

> You cast arcane spells, which are drawn from the duskblade spell list on page 98. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time.
 
> To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell level + your Int modifier.

> You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–3. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–1: Ability Modiﬁ ers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player’s Handbook.) 

> Errata: Page 19 – Duskblade Class Features: Spells [Substitution]
> 
> The first paragraph of the "Spells" class feature should read: "A duskblade casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the duskblade spell list on page 24. Duskblade spells unique to this book appear on a spell list Page 98 

> Errata: Page 19 – Duskblade Class Features: Spells [Omission]
> 
> The duskblade "Spells" class feature should have a sentence that reads the following at the end of the last paragraph: "A duskblade’s caster level is equivalent to his class level."

## Spells Known

> You begin play knowing two 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells, chosen from the duskblade spell list. You also know one additional 0-level spell for each point of Intelligence bonus.

> Each time you gain a new class level, you learn one additional spell of any level you can cast, chosen from the duskblade spell list.

> Upon reaching 5th level, and at every subsequent oddnumbered level, you can choose to learn a new spell in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose access to the old spell in exchange for gaining the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For instance, upon reaching 9th level, you could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two levels below the highest-level spell you can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. You can swap only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that you gain new spells known for the level.

> You need not prepare spells in advance. You can cast any spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your spells per day for that spell level. 

## Arcane Attunement (Sp)

> You can use the spell-like powers dancing lights, detect magic, flare, ghost sound, and read magic a combined total of times per day equal to 3 + your Int modifier. These spell-like powers do not count against your total of spells known or spells per day.

There is a selection of feats from Drow of the Underdark that upgrade spell-like abilities. Since arcane attunement grants spell-like abilities, duskblade is qualified to pick them. These are great picks for level 1, especially if you can retrain them at later levels.

Fascinating Illumination should be the feat you should pick if you are using this trick. It enables you to transform dancing lights into hypnotic pattern. Hypnotic pattern is a level 2 spell that can fascinate 2d4 + caster level of hit dice. A fascinated creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. You can't take hostile actions without breaking the effect against the affected creature.

Deceptive Illumination transforms dancing lights to silent images. Silent image is a powerful spell against enemies that are not intelligent. However, dungeon masters tend to dislike silent image being an answer to anything without brains.

The artificer's monocle from Magic Item Compendium can be used to transform detect magic to identify magic items.

## Armored Mage (Ex)

> Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A duskblade's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows you to avoid arcane spell failure so long as you stick to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavy armors, nor to heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class.

> At 4th level, you learn to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure.

> At 7th level, you learn to use a heavy shield with no chance of arcane spell failure.

## Combat Casting

> At 2nd level, you gain Combat Casting as a bonus feat. 

## Arcane Channeling (Su)

> Beginning at 3rd level, you can use a standard action to cast any touch spell you know and deliver the spell through your weapon with a melee attack. Casting a spell in this manner does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If the melee attack is successful, the attack deals damage normally; then the effect of the spell is resolved.

> At 13th level, you can cast any touch spell you know as part of a full attack action, and the spell affects each target you hit in melee combat that round. Doing so discharges the spell at the end of the round, in the case of a touch spell that would otherwise last longer than 1 round.

## Quick Cast

> Beginning at 5th level, you can cast one spell each day as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the spell is 1 standard action or less.

> You can use this ability twice per day at 10th level, three times per day at 15th level, and four times per day at 20th level.

## Spell Power (Ex)

> Starting at 6th level, you can more easily overcome the spell resistance of any opponent you successfully injure with a melee attack. If you have injured an opponent with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance for the remainder of the encounter. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level, to +4 at 16th level, and to +5 at 18th level.
