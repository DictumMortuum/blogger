## introduction

A fighter might be bland, but thankfully it's a malleable class. Unfortunately for the player that wants to be a fighter, he doesn't have the in-game versatility of the spellcasting classes: they can rest, change their spells and essentially be an almost completely different character - their feat and prestige class selection might not be subject to change, but what mostly deals with enemies and helps their teammates is their spells. To make an analogy, a fighter is like cement: you can work with it at first, but once it hardens it's generally too difficult to make drastic changes; on the other hand, classes that generally rely on spells are like plasteline clay: their attribute (which is basically their color) remains the same, but you can shape it as you wish.

So, since you decided to play a fighter, the best thing that you can do in order to be successful and actually help your party is to come prepared; study the builds of your party members and find out the weak spots; try to fill them in. This is actually a tricky process, since you won't generally have full knowledge of the builds while you're making your own, so you'll have to rely, at least partially, to previous experiences that you had with your friends. You can also get important information that can influence your build choices by your in-game battles, so make sure to keep a few notes when during an encounter something really bad happens to you or to a teammate that could prove to be disastrous to the party.

I felt the urge to write a few words on this subject, mainly because I've many times experienced players that make their builds independently of their party. I've also heard players stating that they don't want to play spellcasting classes, because they have a lot of bookkeeping. While that is generally true, this doesn't mean that fighters don't have bookkeeping to do; a spellcaster memorizes or selects spells trying to cover as many threats as possible, which is what a fighter should also do - the threats are the same, the only thing that changes is the means they employ in order to deal with them: one has spells, the other has special abilities and weapons. During character creation your cement isn't dry yet, so you can make any changes you like; try to work with it in order to fit your team best, don't let it dry and then regret your choices.

Since you already decided that the bulk of your levels will be spent in the fighter class, naturally, you want to be able to use weapons as your main source of damage. This is perfectly fine and there are many different combat styles that you can specialize in that deal a lot of damage. However, you need to remember that there are many ways in order to avoid or be immune to physical attacks; this guide will expand on hitting hard with your favorite weapons or styles, while tackling the subject of what you will actually do when your weapons prove worthless versus your enemies.

## attributes

The fighter is a class that's deceptively MAD. At first glance they look like they don't need multiple statistics, but that's not the case, as all attributes are beneficial, maybe with the exception of Charisma, which is optional.

However, not all of the statistics need to be kept high. An average starting score in all attributes will serve most fighter builds fine. If the game you are playing a fighter in uses point buy, then make every bit of them count; even with 28 points, you can allocate 14/14/14 in your physical scores, a 14 in your primary mental stat and 10 in the other two.

Spellcasters dump as many points as they can in their primary mental attribute because it gives them extra spells per day and it increases their spell DC. These two abilities are not easily replicated through items or class abilities. Even when you encounter them, they are often difficult to acquire. On the other hand, a fighter can easily get bonuses to hit and to damage, which is analogous to increasing his primary combat atttribute.

What I mention above applies mainly to character creation. After this process you will most certainly try to make the most out of your primary combat attribute using level up bonuses and items, as well as independent boosts to your to hit score and damage.

### <span class="blue">strength</span>

**What people think it's useful for:** melee attack rolls.
**What it is actually useful for:** damage.

Strength boosts your attack rolls when using melee weapons. Because of this fact, it's often mistakenly associated with the key attribute of melee combat. In reality, strength is able to boost the damage of pretty much any combat style: ranged (through composite bows), throwing weapons and melee. This is true even for dual wielding builds, which are traditionally dexterity based. Granted, you are getting only one half of your strength bonus on off-hand attacks, so it's not the best option, but it works.

We have established that you will have to invest in strength to have a cheap and readily available damage source with virtually any weapon. Now the question that you need to ponder on while planning your melee fighter build is if you want to have strength as your main combat attribute. Strength is straightforward, meaning that it won't bother you and it will just work. You won't need to rely on feats or class features like Weapon Finesse to switch to another attribute for melee fighting. You will be able to boost it easily with low level spells like enlarge person and fist of stone.

Strength is also useful because it contributes to strength checks and most of the special attacks: bull rush, overrun and trip. Even if you don't want to use these maneuvers, having a good strength score will provide you some bonus if you are defending against them, as most of them are opposed checks.

As a final note, because of the way that carrying capacity works, strength is an attribute that gives you a marginal benefit even when it's not even.

### <span class="blue">dexterity</span>

**What people think it's useful for:** ranged attack rolls.
**What it is actually useful for:** combat reflexes.

Dexterity is going to be used as your main combat attribute when using ranged weapons like bows, crossbows and throwing axes. The trouble that these builds have is that they need to invest in strength, or they need another source of extra damage like specific feats, such as crossbow sniper or dead eye.

Dexterity increases reflex saves, armor class and touch armor class. The most important of these stats is touch armor class, which is difficult to increase through items and abilities. I am conflicted about its actual usefulness beyond a certain level, though, because it's far easier to increase attack rolls that it is to increase touch armor class.

Dexterity is a requirement for many different feats, especially for those that fit in the archery and the two weapon fighting styles. One of the most important of them is the combat reflexes feat from Player's Handbook. This feat, combined with some of its upgrades (for instance, robilar's gambit) are the basis for builds that use attacks of opportunity as a source of generating extra attacks per round.

### <span class="blue">constitution</span>

Constitution is important for all characters, especially when you are going to be in melee range. Truth be told, if you select the fighter class, you already have a pretty good hit die and good fortitude saving throws, but almost everyone can spare a 14 in constitution before racial modifiers. Whatever you do, try to keep positive bonuses in your constitution, it's invaluable.

### intelligence

Intelligence is sneakily useful when planning a fighter build.

The first benefit that it provides is obvious: skill points. Fighters get the lowest number of skill points per level up. If you need skill points to fulfill the requirements of a feat or a prestige class, then plan ahead and if need be, get a 12 or 14 in intelligence.

If you need the combat expertise feat for your build, you'll have to have a minimum of 13 in intelligence, because that's its requirement. Since the difference between a 13 and a 14 are formidable, compared to the investment, consider spending an additional point to benefit from the extra skill point.

### wisdom

The purpose of this attribute is to boost your will saving throw, especially early in your career, where you will generally be unable to purchase effective equipment that boosts saving throws.

Whatever you do, spend a couple of points to get wisdom to 10. This way, you won't be getting any negative modifiers, as starting out with a negative saving throw score is going to be brutal. Races that have penalties to wisdom are extremely rare, so that 10 won't be reduced by racial modifiers.

Wisdom is the key skill for most of the detection skills: listen, spot and sense motive; these skills are useful for any character, but listen and spot are not class skills for the fighter class.

Some feats, especially the Combat Form line, have wisdom as a requirement, but most of them do not have that much of an impact to have a whole playstyle revolving around them.

### charisma

Charisma is completely optional, which makes it a prime candidate for dumping. It can provide a couple of interesting abilities to your repertoire, but it's nothing that you can't live with.

Demoralize is an option that's provided by the intimidate skill and it's an effective tactic against enemies that are not immune to mind-affecting effects. If the demoralize attempt is successful, then the target becomes shaken for 1 round and takes a -2 penalty to almost everything. Additionally, fear effects stack, so demoralize becomes better if other people in your party use the same tactic.

This skill check works even if your charisma score is low; however, ever since the sourcebook Drow of the Underdark was released, the demoralize maneuver was improved dramatically, because of a feat named Imperious Command, which has a requirement of 15 in charisma.

## archetypes

Archetypes are four categories that I've got in mind and use them in order to categorize martial characters, based on the way that they contribute to battle.

The **brute** specializes in hitting hard by optimizing his power attack damage. The Brute is playable at almost all levels, but is really able to come online after the 6th or so level.

The **tempest** tries to increase his damage output by increasing the number of attacks he gets in a round. Most tempests require many feats, items and class abilities in order to be effective, so tempest builds are pretty late to bloom.

The **support** employs battlefield control through exotic weapons and combat feats. Even though it doesn't focus on damage primarily, it's one of the most effective low-level choices for a fighter and continues to be effective at all levels, depending on your feats.

The **blasphemer** dabbles with magic to enhance his combat ability. This archetype requires some levels in the abjurant champion prestige class (preferably all five), so it's playable at the mid level range (around 11-12).

### brute & tempest hybrid

Combining these two archetypes is straightforward: you're trying to maximize attacks per round and power attack damage.

Fighting with two weapons and using Power Attack is generally considered to be a very bad idea, not only because you get to add half the amount of the penalty that you apply to your attack rolls (instead of twice that, when using a two-handed weapon), but also because fighting with two weapons incurs additional attack roll penalties (best case scenario, -2 to both hands). Additionally, two weapon fighters prefer light weapons, in order to lessen their penalties, but you can't Power Attack with those, so you're forced to spend additional feats in Oversized Two-Weapon Fighting. If you want to make a hybrid build that incorporates Two Weapon Fighting and Power Attack efficiently, then you'll have to use the Exotic Weapon Master or the Revenant Blade, but do note that they both use double weapons in order to achieve this.

Another option is acquiring multiple natural attacks, which does not affect your attack routine, but, since natural attacks are considered to be one-handed attacks, you don't get the multiplier to the power attack damage, as two-handed weapons do.

These characters want to take as many full-attacks as possible in a given fight, so, since their weapon selection is usually limited, they try to acquire additional ways to move for free or just charge, dipping into Barbarian for the Lion Totem Barbarian alternative class feature. Shock Trooper also is a very useful feat, because it lessens the attack penalties while providing you with full Power Attack power.

### brute & support hybrid

One of the easiest hybrids, this fighter acquires a bit of crowd-controlling feats, like Brutal Strike and Driving Attack that directly benefit from having a high Power Attack damage output.

These hybrids also use multiple feats that augment bull rushing, like Pushback, Knockback, Shock Trooper and the alternative class feature Dungeoncrasher.

### brute & blasphemer hybrid
 
This combination specializes in maximizing his Power Attack damage through magic means, for instance by getting touch attacks (e.g. the spell Wraithstrike is a staple feat that enables that kind of thing).

Since the blasphemer can also acquire strong mounts through the Improved Familiar feats, a mounted brute also works in order to receive some cheap Power Attack modifiers, like spirited charge.

### tempest & support hybrid

There are multiple attack modes, like trip, disarm and grapple and these do not depend on damage, but they do cost an attack. Getting additional attacks are very useful in order to make these work and the tempest provides a solid base for this kind of crowd control.

Additionally, feats like Boomerang Daze and Three Mountains directly benefit from a high number of attacks per round.

Finally, a special type of feats exist mainly in Complete Warrior (but also other books), called [Style] feats. These feats give you additional benefits for fighting with two specific weapons and for this reason they regularly require the Two Weapon Fighting feat, like High Sword, Low Axe.

### tempest & blasphemer hybrid

Tempest + Blasphemer = A two-weapon fighter that enhances his weapon damage or his attack rolls with spells

### support & blasphemer hybrid

Support + Blasphemer = Bladeweave, exotic weapons

## multiclassing

### the odd-level horror

Simply put, don't make builds with an odd number of fighter levels.

Readers that are following the optimization community are familiar with this notion; as a matter of fact, it is number six of Caelic's [ten commandments of practical optimization](http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?topic=4136.0).

The reasoning behind this commandment is that you are getting nothing new from those fighter levels and you are better off dipping in other classes (with a strong preference on those that feature full base attack bonus), in order to get additional special abilities. However, do keep in mind that this piece of multiclassing advice is only true for finished builds. Do not be afraid to enter a prestige class after five fighter levels. Many prestige classes have a base attack bonus requirement of +5 or +7. You can get that even fighter level later in your build and at the same time you will grab a bonus [fighter] feat. If you plan everything beforehand, getting that feat may be more powerful, too, as you will be able to fulfill additional requirements (e.g. higher base attack bonus).

However, do note that a good break-off point for dipping and switching to prestige classes is the sixth fighter level, because the bonuses you're getting at that level (additional attack and two feats) increase your power exponentially.
